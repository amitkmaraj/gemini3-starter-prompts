Welcome to the **Gemini 3 Prompts Repository**. This collection contains a suite of "Distinguished Engineer" level prompt specifications designed to push the limits of Google's latest **Gemini 3** model.

These prompts are meant to show you some of the creative capabilities of Google's new model. They leverage the model's new **"Deep Think"** capabilities, advanced **Multimodal Understanding**, and **Long-Context** reasoning.

## 🚀 Introducing Gemini 3

As announced in the [official Google Blog post](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/), Gemini 3 represents a massive leap forward in AI capability.

### Key Features exploited in these prompts:

*   **🧠 Deep Think Mode:** A new reasoning engine that allows the model to "think" before it speaks. It performs mental execution of code, traces complex logic, and generates internal monologues to solve non-deterministic bugs.
*   **👀 Native Multimodality:** Seamlessly understands and correlates video, audio, images, and text. It can watch a video of your room to build a memory palace or listen to your voice to detect frustration.
*   **🕵️ Agentic Workflows:** Designed for the new **Google Antigravity** platform, these prompts demonstrate how to build autonomous agents that can plan, code, and critique their own work.
*   **📚 Long-Horizon Planning:** The ability to maintain a coherent "World State" across thousands of lines of code generation and multi-turn conversations.

## 📂 The Prompts

Each file in this repository is a standalone specification for a killer app or tool.

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
*   **[`01_deep_think_debugger.md`](./01_deep_think_debugger.md)**: A CLI tool that finds *why* code broke, not just *where*. Uses "Deep Think" to trace race conditions and logic gaps.
*   **[`04_empathetic_ide.md`](./04_empathetic_ide.md)**: A VS Code extension that uses audio and typing patterns to detect "coding rage" and intervene with help.
*   **[`05_autonomous_software_house.md`](./05_autonomous_software_house.md)**: A multi-agent system where an Architect, Backend Dev, and Frontend Dev build a full app from one sentence.
*   **[`09_legacy_migrator.md`](./09_legacy_migrator.md)**: A "Code Archaeologist" that migrates legacy COBOL/Java to Rust, adding comments explaining the *history* behind the old code.

### 🎓 Education & Knowledge
*   **[`02_multimodal_memory_palace.md`](./02_multimodal_memory_palace.md)**: An AR web app that watches a video of your room and anchors digital notes to physical objects.
*   **[`03_paper_to_simulation.md`](./03_paper_to_simulation.md)**: Turns static PDF research papers into interactive Streamlit dashboards with playable variables.
*   **[`06_talking_artifacts.md`](./06_talking_artifacts.md)**: Gives museum artifacts a voice and persona (via TTS) based on visual identification.
*   **[`10_antigravity_tutor.md`](./10_antigravity_tutor.md)**: An autonomous agent that scans your reading history, finds "knowledge gaps," and emails you custom micro-lessons.
*   **[`12_course_creator.md`](./12_course_creator.md)**: A multi-agent architecture for generating comprehensive online courses from raw materials.

### 🎨 Creativity & Soft Skills
*   **[`07_nuanced_negotiator.md`](./07_nuanced_negotiator.md)**: A roleplay simulator with a "Shadow Analyst" that critiques your emotional intelligence and subtext in real-time.
*   **[`08_dream_architect.md`](./08_dream_architect.md)**: A pipeline that converts chaotic dream descriptions into cinematic movie trailers (Script -> Image -> Audio -> Video).
*   **[`13_toronto_skyline.md`](./13_toronto_skyline.md)**: A creative prompt for generating a stylized, artistic representation of the Toronto skyline.
*   **[`14_doodle_dodge.md`](./14_doodle_dodge.md)**: A polished, hand-drawn endless runner game ("Doodle Dodge") built with React and HTML5 Canvas.

### 💰 Personal Finance
*   **[`11_expense_tracker.md`](./11_expense_tracker.md)**: A smart expense tracker web app that categorizes transactions and provides financial insights using AI.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Select a Prompt:** Open any `.md` file in this repo.
2.  **Copy the Content:** Copy the text inside the quote block (or the entire goal/prompt section).
3.  **Execute:**
    *   **AI Studio / Gemini Advanced:** Paste the prompt directly to see the model generate the architecture, code, and reasoning.
    *   **API Integration:** Use these descriptions as the `system_instruction` or initial user message in your Python/Node.js applications using the Google GenAI SDK.
